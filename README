This tool could be used with Cisco VSM application. This tool could be used to
find location of a camera across number of VSOMs. 

To use it, specify a camera name or a string which is part of the camera name in
get_camera_location.py. After that, once you run it, it calls all the VSOMs 
listed in vsoms.properties file and returns all the matching locations for a 
camera.
It is efficient as it caches all the data in a pickle file and doesn't makes a call everytime
to all VSOMs.

HOW TO USE IT:

- In get_camera_location.py, specify camera_name or a string which is part of camera_name 
- In vsoms.properties, specify all the VSOMs with credentials. 
  
  e.g. 10.*.*.*  admin <password>
  
  Please use a new line to specify each VSOM IP & credentials
  
  e.g. 10.*.*.* admin <password>
       10.*.*.* admin <password>
       10.*.*.* admin <password>
       10.*.*.* admin <password>
      
  Please note it will pull cameras only for those locations for which the user has rights to.
- You can comment a line in vsoms.properties with a #
